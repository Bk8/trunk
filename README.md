Libprot v.0.0.1 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Libprot is written on C++ and designed to provide with simple 
functionality of software protection. 

Full sources codes are included and may be modified to fit the 
current needs.

In the current version:

* Asymmetric crypt algorithm
* Modification detection of application
* Representation of binary data as text string (hex encoding)
* Obfuscation of string (may be used in key generation)
* Mechanism of application crashing at random place

The feedback is very important for us. The future versions are based 
on it. It’s in plans to release new versions with implementation of 
better and safer algorithms.
