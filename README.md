Libprot v.0.0.1 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Libprot is designed to provide you with a basic functionality of software
protection.

Full sources codes are included and may be modified to fit the current 
needs.

It's easiest solution to protect your software, but it will help to limit
the piracy and increase profit of a company.

Project in development stage and your feedback is very important for me. 
Feel free to contact. 

In the current version:

1)	XOR crypt (very basic algorithm to obfuscate data and make it less obvious)
2)	Bin2Hex – to represent binary data as hex (numbers from 0 to 9 and letters 
        from A to F) array
3)	PE Check Sum – recalculate the check sum of a PE file
4)	Example to generate a key and check it validity
5)	Asymmetric algorithm with public and private key
